<H2>Using Stable audio open</H2>

<p align="center">
  <H3>
    This is a toy project tuning the Stable-Audio model, <br>
    which boasts excellent performance in generating music based on input words <br>
    that specify the desired genre and type.
  </H3>
  <br>
  <H3>
    The model requires a significant amount of VRAM for training, <br>
    so I used Google Colab Plus for tuning.
  </H3>
  <br>
  <H3>
    The data is too large to upload to Git, <br>
    so I wasn't able to do that. <br>
    By appropriately modifying the values in <code>dataset.json</code> and <code>model_config.json</code>, <br>
    I was able to proceed.
  </H3>
  <br>
  <H3>
    After downloading <code>stable-audio-tools</code>, <br>
    you can run the files within to get it operational.
