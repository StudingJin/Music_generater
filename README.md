<h3>Using Stable audio open</h3>

This is a toy project tuning the Stable-Audio model, which boasts excellent performance in generating music based on input words that specify the desired genre and type.

The model requires a significant amount of VRAM for training, so I used Google Colab Plus for tuning.

The data is too large to upload to Git, so I wasn't able to do that. By appropriately modifying the values in dataset.json and model_config.json, I was able to proceed.

After downloading stable-audio-tools, you can run the files within to get it operational.
